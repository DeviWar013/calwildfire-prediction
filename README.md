# calwildfire-prediction
This academic project explores patterns of California wildfires using machine learning techniques. All relevant data sources and code will be provided in this repository. Please reach out with any inquiries or collaboration interests.

## Objectives

- Analyze spatiotemporal patterns of wildfires in California
- Construct a space-time grid dataset from GIS fire perimeter data
- Train machine learning models to predict fire susceptibility

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- geopandas, rasterio, shapely, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn

(Install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
